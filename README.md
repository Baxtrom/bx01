My first attempt at building a hand-wired, custom, 3d printed gaming keyboard/macro pad with hotswap 

The layout, case and plate have all been designed by me. The keyboard runs on an Arduino Pro Micro running custom QMK firmware and has VIA support. The current layout has 3 layers, 2 of which are mostly empty, but I plan on adding more later. I also don't have any lighting yet, but I want to add more later. 

The case has risers for the pro micro and it clicks/locks in place pretty solidly. It also has supports to minimize plate flex, that are designed in two parts and can be adjusted up and down and have a bit of dampening (provided my small elastics around the bottom section). The plate is 1.5 mm thick (mx switch spec) which allows the switches and the stabilizer to click in. They were designed in blender and printed on an Ender 3 in pla at 0.2mm layer height and have pretty good tolerances. The only part I didn't design is the hot-swap sockets, which were made by Jan Lunge (https://github.com/JanLunge/keyboards/blob/main/hotswap_socket/hotswap_mx__compact.stl) and work great in this project.
