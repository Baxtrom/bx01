> The hotswap sockets are not my own design all credit goes to Jan lunge. The original repo is [here](https://github.com/JanLunge/keyboards/blob/504df51700978bed737fc10f7224ae83d47c33f2/hotswap_socket/hotswap_mx__compact.stl)
> There are multiple version that could accomodate your needs better.

The prints were done on an Ender 3 at 0.2mm layer height with default settings
